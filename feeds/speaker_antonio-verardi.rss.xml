(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0&lt;/a&gt;), I’d like to present a
pattern that can be used to design clean and pythonic interfaces for
programmers based on replacing single-method classes with decorated
functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern is already used by some famous frameworks and libraries,
like Pyramid (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://trypyramid.com/"&gt;https://trypyramid.com/&lt;/a&gt;), but I believe it isn’t that
well-known to many (even experienced) Python developers and is not as
widely used as it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll show how this pattern can be employed to improve a programming
interface which is used by an internal log processing framework at
Yelp. This will demonstrate how a more functional approach,
leveraging the power of Python decorators, can lead to simpler, more
beautiful and easier to understand code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this talk doesn’t suggest giving up classes altogether, but
making use of them only when they are truly useful. In fact, the
use-case I’m going to analyze will combine classes, functions, and
decorators to make the best out of these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the presentation is going to be very code-oriented, the
talk is intended for an audience of developers who are already
familiar with most Python constructs, including decorators, even
though the concept will be briefly introduced at the beginning of the
talk. But, if you are one of these people, I promise you that the
code will speak for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
