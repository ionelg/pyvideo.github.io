We
followed the tutorial and yet we got an error. We introduce a new
feature but something else broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having to deal with bugs is inevitable. Trying to &amp;quot;debug&amp;quot; what
happened or what caused the problem can be really frustrating and
timewasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this talk is go give ways to think &amp;amp; steps to take
when we are faced with the process of debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language for the examples is going to be Python &amp;amp; the tools
used - from the python ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will be practical, with a lot of real-world examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to cover the following scenarios by showing different ways to approch the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You followed a tutorial but it's not working. What to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You introduce new feature but things broke somewhere else in the project. What to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are using a popular 3rd party library but something breaks. What to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bug occurs and you have no idea what or who caused it. What to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can't fix or find the bug. What now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to generalize your debugging skills. How to do that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be talking about critical changes, binary search, problem
isolation, interactive debuggers, printing, testing, greping and
other interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;
