&lt;p&gt;Uwe Korn is a Data Scientist at the Karlsruhe-based RetailTec company Blue Yonder. His expertise is on building architectures for machine learning services that are scalably usable for multiple customers aiming at high service availability as well as rapid prototyping of solutions to evaluate the feasibility of his design decisions. As part of his work to provide an efficient data interchange he became a core committer to the Apache Parquet and Apache Arrow projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Python itself hosts a wide range of machine learning and data tools, other ecosystems like the Hadoop world also provide beneficial tools that can be either connected via Apache Parquet files or in memory using Arrow. This talks shows recent developments that allow interoperation at speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python has a vast amount of libraries and tools in its machine learning and data analysis ecosystem. Although it is clearly in competition with R here about the leadership, the world that has sprung out of the Hadoop ecosystem has established itself in the space of data engineering and also tries to provide tools for distributed machine learning. As these stacks run in different environments and are mostly developed by distinct groups of people, using them together has been a pain. While Apache Parquet has already proven itself as the gold standard for the exchange of DataFrames serialized to files, Apache Arrow recently got traction as the in-memory format for DataFrame exchange between different ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will outline how Apache Parquet files can be used in Python and how they are structured to provide efficient DataFrame exchange. In addition to small code sample, this also includes an explanation of some interesting details of the file format. Additionally, the idea of Apache Arrow will be presented and taking Apache Spark (2.3) as an example to showcase how performance increases once DataFrames can be efficiently shared between Python and JVM processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description
Apache Parquet is the most used columnar data format in the big data processing space and recently gained Pandas support. It leverages various techniques to store data in a CPU and I/O efficient way and provides capabilities to push-down queries to the I/O layer. In this talk, it is shown how to use it in Python, detail its structure and present the portable usage with other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Since its creation in 2013, Apache Parquet has risen to be the most widely used binary columnar storage format in the big data processing space. While supporting basic attributes of a columnar format like reading a subset of columns, it also leverages techniques to store the data efficiently while providing fast access. In addition the format is structured in such a fashion that when supplied to a query engine, Parquet provides indexing hints and statistics to quickly skip over chunks of irrelevant data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, efficient implementations to load and store Parquet files in Python became available, bringing the efficiency of the format to Pandas DataFrames. While this provides a new option to store DataFrames, it especially allows us to share data between Pandas and a lot of other popular systems like Apache Spark or Apache Impala. In this talk we will show the improvements that Parquet bring performance-wise but also will highlight important aspects of the format that make it portable and efficient for queries on large amount of data. As not all features are yet available in Python, an overview of the upcoming Python-specific improvements and how the Parquet format will be extended in general is given at the end of the talk&lt;/p&gt;
