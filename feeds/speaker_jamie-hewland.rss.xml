Docker container image for use on a container orchestration platform.
Starting with a common Django setup involving Nginx, Gunicorn, and
Celery, we will show how to adapt the application to run inside
containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes and DC/OS are
growing increasingly popular. These systems provide many advantages, but
require significant changes to how applications are packaged and
deployed. Instead of running on staticly-configured webservers,
applications must run in containers that are dynamically deployed to a
pool of hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are further benefits to packaging applications as containers. By
providing an easy-to-use and tested base image for Django applications,
deployment best-practices are easily and consistently replicated.
Integration testing becomes more practical, as containers can be run
similarly between development and production environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk expects some familiarity with Django, as well as the basics of
Docker and HTTP. There should be lessons relevant to anybody interested
in using Docker for Python-based web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
