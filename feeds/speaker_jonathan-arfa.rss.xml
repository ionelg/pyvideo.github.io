We will build off of Gabe’s PyGotham 2016    talk (The Sounds Of Data: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb9c_WFMYeI"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb9c_WFMYeI&lt;/a&gt;)    and will attempt to implement an RNN based on Alex Graves’ GeneratingSequences With Recurrent Neural Networks    (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf"&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Reservoir sampling is a commonly used algorithm for keeping a sample that's unbiased over all events in the stream. But what if you want your algorithm to keep a representative sample from the past 10 minutes instead of the entire stream? In this talk I'll start with a gentle introduction to Reservoir sampling for those who are not familiar with it, and then discuss several variants which keep a sample that is biased towards the present. One of these is the VIRB (Variable Incoming Rate Biased) sampler, which we have developed in-house at Magnetic. This talk covers the same material as this blog post: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tech.magnetic.com/2016/04/virbs-sampling-events-from-streams.html"&gt;http://tech.magnetic.com/2016/04/virbs-sampling-events-from-streams.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
