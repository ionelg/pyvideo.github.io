Therefore, practical knowledge concerning lightning data formats, services, and visualization approaches is underdeveloped. Using data from new instruments and recent field campaigns we will show the utility of xarray and other Python tools for traversing and visualizing lighting data alongside other meteorological datasets, with a view toward reference implementations that speed use of lightning data by the wider scientific and operational forecasting community.&lt;/p&gt;

adaptability to many problems. Scientific computing and web development
are two examples of such communities. These might, at first glance, seem
to share few common interests, especially at the level of algorithms and
libraries. However, at the level of integrated practice in
time-constrained academic environments, where framework development is
less valued than research and teaching productivity, ease of adoption of
tools from each of these communities can be tremendously valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using examples from the recently-deployed West Texas Lightning Mapping
Array, which is processed and visualized in real-time, this paper will
argue that a shared sense, among disciplinary communities, of the
essence of how one deploys Python for specific problems is beneficial
for continuation and growth of Python's status as a go-to language for
practitioners in academic settings.&lt;/p&gt;
