&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will take a tour of all the pieces that go into making a web application, and show how they all fit together -- using specific choices, specific examples and a lot of hands-on programming, to give participants a chance to  actually write a web applications: all the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use some external third-party services, but care is taken to fit into the free tier.&lt;/p&gt;

Time to market and lopsided hiring of inexperienced developers often ends up delivering a product that works, but is riddled with Python anti-patterns. How to move towards best practices while maintaining development velocity and product stability?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real life is messy. Real companies doubly so. While, of course, the decision to use Python is a good one, often developers are hired who are either inexperienced or are new to Python. Following best practices, or even learning what they are, or even avoiding replicating Java/C++ in Python, are treated as luxuries reserved for bigger companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After enough pain-- in the form of production outages-- is experienced, it is often possible to convince companies that efforts need to be made to bring their code up to date. What is the best way to achieve that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will talk about practices to update to the newest version of Python, and the newest versions of libraries, while avoiding (most) risk. We will cover techniques to introduce static analysis, and better unit testing, to reduce the chance of customer-facing problems. We will also cover how to refactor large mono-repos into manageable pieces using pip, pants and pex. Finally, we will cover how to introduce a microservice architecture gradually, in order to isolate faults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moshe is a core Twisted contributor, and has contributed to core Python. He has building and deploying web applications since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

1. Automate AWS With Python - Moshe Zadka
AWS is one of the best-known cloud vendors. Using the Web UI is fine when starting out, but automating cloud operations is important. Boto3 provides a great Pythonic API to AWS, but using it correctly can be subtle.
The talk will cover how to automate AMI builds, building Cloud Formation Templates and automating S3 bucket management.
Speaker Bio
Moshe has been involved with Python since 1998, when he helped obsolete math-related modules. Since then, he made some contributions that were not just deleting code to core Python, and has been a contributor on the Twisted project since its inception.

2. Yes, It's Time to Learn Regular Expressions - Al Sweigart
Regular expressions have a reputation as opaque and inscrutable. However, the basic concepts behind &amp;quot;regex&amp;quot; and text pattern recognition are simple to grasp. This talk is for any programmer who isn't familiar with Python's re module and its best practices. Stop putting it off, it's time to learn regular expressions!

3. Type uWSGI; press enter; what happens? - Asheesh Laroia and Philip James
You're a pretty knowledgeable Python web application developer, but how does that web application get served to the world? For many of us, uWSGI is the magic that makes our application available, and in this talk we'll look at how uWSGI works with the OS and the networking stack to make the magic happen.

which efficiently publish and consume services and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, we will combine 4 Python-based technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jupyter is a real-time development environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twisted is a powerful platform for network programming that supports
many protocols, including HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klein is a Twisted-based web application framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treq is a Requests-style HTTP client based on Twisted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining all of these we will guide students through &lt;em&gt;interactively
prototyping&lt;/em&gt; a production quality web application that &lt;em&gt;publishes&lt;/em&gt; both
&lt;em&gt;service APIs&lt;/em&gt; and web resources such as HTML, and that can &lt;em&gt;efficiently
consume many back-end services&lt;/em&gt; such as 3rd-party APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

For such repositories, Pants (build in Python for Python, Java, C++ and more) helps maintain dependencies and build (mostly) stand-alone executables which simplify deployment.
​
Abstract
Pants is a modern build system written in Python. It can build Python, Java, C++, Go and more. Twitter, Square and FourSquare use it internally, and contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;

Moshe is a Twisted contributor, and has contributed to core Python. He loves infrastructure for building, monitoring and making services highly available.&lt;/p&gt;
