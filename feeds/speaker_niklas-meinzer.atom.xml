frameworks are not flexible enough for your needs? Do you feel like
they limit you in your creativity and design? Then this talk is for
you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Werkzeug is a very lightweight HTTP/WSGI utility for Python. You
might have actually used it before, since the popular framework Flask
is based on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Werkzeug handles the WSGI communication with the web server and
parsing of HTTP packets for you, after that, you are left to do
whatever you want. No pre-defined ORM, no request dispatching or
template rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer you are supported with a live debugger that runs in
the browser and a great variety of testing tools making it easy to
write fine grained unit tests for your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer at MPS - Medical Systems, I work with Werkzeug on a
daily basis. One of our products is ChemoCompile,  a chemo therapy
planning, management and documentation tool used in hospitals in
various European countries. It is a single-page web application
written in Python (backend) and AngularJS (frontend). When we created
it, we first prototyped it using Django, but soon realized, that we
did not need most of the functionality that Django provides and many
of our needs, like interfacing with hospital information systems, are
too much out of the scope of a regular web applications. I will talk
about, how we then discovered Werkzeug and built our own very
customized stack on top of it and how you can do it too!&lt;/p&gt;
