It's for people with curioisty to feed, anxiety to overcome, and worlds to change. It's for people named Edna. (And others not named Edna.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this tutorial you'll be encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;bring your whole self to learning&lt;/strong&gt;. We'll start with the very basics of Python, keeping your fingers on the keyboard to gain as much practice as possible. Between strings, functions, and other fun Python-y things, we'll discuss learning deeply, &lt;strong&gt;nourishing our brains&lt;/strong&gt;, and boosting happiness with science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No prior experience required; come just as you are. &lt;strong&gt;This is about being a whole person&lt;/strong&gt;. It's about learning Python, because Python is really cool. It's also about staying afloat. Being productive. Focusing. It's about finding joy in the error codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come play. It'll be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started my first Django project, I took the “Sure, I think I can figure that out” approach, which is fun! And also dangerous. But exciting! And also horrible because I caused myself a lot of trouble and barfed on my keyboard. (Metaphorically.) Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope for this talk is to pass along lessons I learned the hard way, and save the world. Or at least prevent some frustration. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;version control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;structuring your project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and how to handle top secret stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;throwing house parties without causing anaphylaxis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pregnant daddy seahorses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;velociraptors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promise all of that is related to Django.&lt;/p&gt;
