automation you will get some insights into growing your own open
source projects into tools that really get used and maintained by a
community. You will get an idea of what pitfalls you have to face
when working with something as fast changing as Instagram and how to
best tackle this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll  learn what the &amp;quot;Page Object&amp;quot; design pattern is, what it is
useful for and why we use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we will also talk about OpenSource and why it's important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the talk will be based on my article on InstaPy published at
the freeCodeCamp publication on Medium:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/my-open-source-instagram-bot-got-me-2-500-real-followers-for-5-in-server-costs-e40491358340"&gt;https://medium.freecodecamp.com/my-open-source-instagram-bot-got-me-2-500-real-followers-for-5-in-server-costs-e40491358340&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, who is this talk suited for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're just starting out with python, are interested in automation
or simply like to see a fun and interesting little open source
project, I'd love to see you at my talk and hear your ideas and
opinions about it.&lt;/p&gt;
