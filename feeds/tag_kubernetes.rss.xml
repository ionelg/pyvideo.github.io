We use this in practice to serve a broad community of atmospheric and climate scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atmospheric and climate scientists analyze large volumes of observational and simulated data to better understand our planet.  They have historically used tools like NumPy and SciPy along with Jupyter notebooks to combine efficient computation with accessibility.  However, as datasets increase in size and collaboration extends to new populations of scientists these tools begin to feel their age.  In this talk we use more recent libraries to build a modern deployment for academic scientists.  In particular we use the following tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dask:&lt;/strong&gt; to parallelize and scale NumPy computations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XArray&lt;/strong&gt;: as a self-discribing data model and tool kit for labeled and index arrays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JupyterLab:&lt;/strong&gt; to enable more APIs for users beyond the classic notebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JupyterHub:&lt;/strong&gt; to manage users and maintain environments for a new population of cloud-friendly users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes:&lt;/strong&gt; to manage everything and deploy easily on cloud hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus less on how these libraries work and will instead be a case study of using them together in an operational setting.  During the talk we will build up and deploy a running system that the audience can then use to access distributed computing resources.&lt;/p&gt;

They have become the currency, the &amp;quot;table stakes&amp;quot; and de-facto application deployment unit. Their raise to the fore has brought about a whole host of use cases which weren't practical or accessible in the world of &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; paradigms of infrastructure and virtualization. Containers have also brought application deployment closer and more accessible to developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as more use cases, deployment styles and exponential adoption of containers was ongoing, a new set of problems began to surface: how do you manage the ever growing number of containers in a deployment? How do you make sure containers have the right resources, deployed to the right machine, running with the correct parameters, how do you scale in and out without disruption? How do you make sure in a fleet of X containers that they’re all running and in healthy state? Enter Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially developed internally by Google to replace their own complex container orchestration and management framework. It had to meet all the stringent standards and mind-boggling scale that Google operates on, but from the get-go an effort was made to make the learning curve and developer experience as approachable as possible. At certain point the creators made the case to Google to release kubernetes to the open source community -- a crucial decision that has helped “k8s” (as it’s commonly referred to as) reach rock star levels of fame and mind share not just in the FOSS community but also across industries and businesses from small operations to gigantic multinational corporations with thousands of deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build and deploy a full-stack application that uses Flask (client-facing app) along with OpenFaaS to handle background processes.&lt;/p&gt;
