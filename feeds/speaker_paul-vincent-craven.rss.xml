Do something visual? Get started today?
Learn how to draw, animate, and use sprites for games with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arcade.academy/"&gt;Python
Arcade&lt;/a&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Arcade” is an easy-to-use Python library for creating 2D arcade games.
We’ll show you how to get started creating your own game, and find
plenty of example code to get an idea of what you can do with this
library. If you are familiar with PyGame, Arcade is easier, more
powerful, and uses recent Python features like type hinting and
decorators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is great for beginners, educators, and people who want to
create their own arcade games.&lt;/p&gt;
