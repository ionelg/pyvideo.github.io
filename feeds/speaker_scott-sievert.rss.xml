Reducing the number of responses required can be done by adapting to previous responses with &amp;quot;adaptive&amp;quot; sampling algorithms, but these algorithms present a fundamental challenge when paired with crowdsourcing. At UWâ€“Madison, we have built a powerful crowdsourcing data collection tool called NEXT (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nextml.org"&gt;http://nextml.org&lt;/a&gt;) that can be used with arbitrary adaptive algorithms. Each week, our system is used by The New Yorker to run their Cartoon Caption contest (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/vote"&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/vote&lt;/a&gt;). In this paper, we will explain what NEXT is and it's applications, architecture and experimentalist use.&lt;/p&gt;
