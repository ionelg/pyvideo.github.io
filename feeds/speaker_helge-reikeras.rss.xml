recent years as companies are realising the value that data can yield
to their products, services, and business decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll discuss a typical data science workflow, from
extracting the raw data through to serving real-time machine learning
predictions using a REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll feature a range of Python tools that make up the Data Science
pipeline, including Pandas, Scikit-learn, Gensim, Luigi, and Flask, and
show how these all can work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real-world implementation done at Offerzen will be presented as an
example.&lt;/p&gt;
