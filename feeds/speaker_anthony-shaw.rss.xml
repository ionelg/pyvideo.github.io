This was later switching for Go, but why? This talk will cover mocker, a container runtime Anthony wrote to understand Docker by rewriting its basic functions in 100% Python.

Whilst the tool might not be production ready, it demonstrates some patterns, libraries and ideas for working with Docker containers from Python.&lt;/p&gt;
