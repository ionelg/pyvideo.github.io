&lt;p&gt;NumPy provides Python with a powerful array processing library and an elegant syntax that is well suited to expressing computational algorithms clearly and efficiently. We'll introduce basic array syntax and array indexing, review some of the available mathematical functions in numpy, and discuss how to write your own routines. Along the way, we'll learn just enough of matplotlib to display results from our examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cython is a foundational technology behind many packages you use everyday, including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Scikit-Image, PyTables, and h5py. Developers, data scientists, and researchers use Cython to accelerate Python, access NumPy efficiently at the C level, and interface Python with C or C++. Cython's expressivity, its stability and maturity, and its gradual typing approach make it a uniquely flexible tool that has become a critical component for many projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will be fast paced, and is geared towards data scientists and Python users looking to take their Python performance to the next level. Basic familiarity with C or C++ is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Unless you work at a large internet company, you probably don't have BIG data, but you might have LARGE data. Large data consume an unacceptable amount of time and memory when medium strategies are used, but also incur unnecessary financial and latency costs when big strategies are used. Two basic strategies for handling large data, chunking and parallelization, will be discussed with live coded examples in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;
I'm a research scientist currently living in the Bay Area and working in neuroethology, human evolution, and natural language processing. I currently work at D-Lab, where I help researchers apply advances in computation to their research paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
