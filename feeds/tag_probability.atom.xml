Where possible/feasible, attendees will build their own tools to help them grasp the underlying concepts. In addition, attendees will be introduced to the pre-built tools in world-class Python and data science libraries to help them capitalize on the efficiencies and utility that those libraries offer.&lt;/p&gt;
