but what does it entail for the daily routing of a distributed
development team? We will talk about tools, the disputed use of email,
Skype, Slack but more specifically about time management, what you can
expect from yourself and from other members of the remote team. Is your
company “remote-friendly” or rather “remote-first”? When it’s time to
spend a few days in physical proximity with your colleagues? We will
share some examples out of the experience of a distributed team actively
working with Python and Django on a daily basis, and show how you can
make it all work, if you work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
