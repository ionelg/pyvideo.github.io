We’ll go through examples of what not to do and how to fix problems. We’ll also talk about compromises that can be made to appease stakeholders and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the growth of the web, how we publish is changing. Paper alone is
not enough, web pages are also required. And for many web pages it is
not enough to rely on the browser’s print capabilities. Sphinx, used
since 2008 for Python’s documentation, is a creative response to this
tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will take a broader view of the problem. For example, many
browsers support web fonts for display but not for printing. Mathematics
on web pages is still difficult, but SVG holds out much promise not only
for mathematics but for tables and other complex typeset material.
Achieving accessibility remains difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on over 15 year’s experience in print and electronic publishing,
this talk will survey problems and emerging solutions. Software and
sites covered include LaTeX, PDF, SVG, MathJax, web-fonts, PediaPress,
Sphinx and arXiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about scoring a government contract, but haven't heard of 508
compliance yet? Interested in making your site accessible to people with
disabilities? Never thought about compliance, but want to know why it's
a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;
