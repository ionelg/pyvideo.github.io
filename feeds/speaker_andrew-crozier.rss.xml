In this talk, I'll go over some practical solutions to deploying models as HTTP APIs on using the Flask web framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python has the unique advantage of not only being the most widely used language for data science, with a rich and mature stack of numerical and machine learning libraries, but also having a rich ecosystem of tooling for implementing web applications. Merging the best of these two worlds allows us to quickly and easily productionise data science models as APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be a practical guide for any data scientist or prospective data engineer wanting to productionise data science models, covering:     Flask     SQLAlchemy (including integration with Flask with Flask-SQLAlchemy)     Handling slow computations with job queues in python-rq     Authorization     Deployment (including gunicorn)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code samples implementing a simple application will be provided online following the talk. Participants should be able to use this as a starting point for deploying their own data science APIs online.&lt;/p&gt;
