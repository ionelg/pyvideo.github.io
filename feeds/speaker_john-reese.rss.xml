Did your beautiful design end up buried in threads and locks? Did Python's very special Global Interpreter Lock make all of this an exercise in futility?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for you! With the combined powers of AsyncIO and multiprocessing, we'll redesign an old multithreaded application limited by the GIL into a modern solution that scales with the demand using only the standard library. No prior AsyncIO or multiprocessing experience required.&lt;/p&gt;
