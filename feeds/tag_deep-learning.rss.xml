Alex is the founder &amp;amp; CTO of NumberBoost, a startup that builds deep learning applications. He previously worked as a quant for a hedge fund and as a data scientist for an e-commerce company. He has an honours degree in actuarial science and a MSc in statistics. He is one of the organizers of the Cape Town Deep Learning meet-up and has built numerous computer vision systems that run at scale in production predicting labels for millions of images per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state-of-the-art in image classification has skyrocketed thanks to the development of deep convolutional neural networks and increases in the amount of data and computing power available to train them. The top-5 error rate in the ImageNet competition to predict which of 1000 classes an image belongs to has plummeted from 28% error in 2010 to just 2.25% in 2017 (human level error is around 5%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to classify objects in images (including not hotdogs), deep learning can be used to automatically generate captions for images, convert photos into paintings, detect cancer in pathology slide images, and help self-driving cars ‘see’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will give an overview of the cutting edge and some of the core mathematical concepts and will also include a short code-first tutorial to show how easy it is to get started using deep learning for computer vision in python…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is a crash course on convolutional neural networks and how to use them to solve 2 real-world applications at scale. The first is an image moderation system and the second is a visual similarity system where a user uploads an image of an item and the system returns visually similar items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before joining REWE digital I worked for Zalando, Fraunhofer IML. My first computer was a VIC-20. I develop professionally software since the 90ies. I am one of the main developers of the new Big data platform of REWE digital, and have deep knowledge about all aspects of the platform. And I have no favorite member of One Direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shop.rewe.de is not only visited by human customers, but also by machines. We have built a deep learning platform using python with Keras, Tensorflow, on the Google infrastructure. In this talk we would like to show you how python is used in practice, supporting 2,5 million visitors each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shop.rewe.de is visited over 2 million times each day. Every visitor is producing thousands of requests in our micro service architecture. We are trying to give the best shopping experience for our customers, and try to keep our platform safe from bad bots. This is partly done by rule sets, and furthermore done by a platform that uses machine learning to classify bad behaviour. In this talk I would like to present our architecture that is not only able to fulfill this use case, but enables our data scientists in general to use our big data platform. the main scope will be the presentation of the use case. I will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;different microservices written in python using flask, google bigquery, tensorflow and keras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scaling this microservices with kubernetes, that automatically starts more predictors in case of higher load&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implementation of quantifiers written in python, that generates data suitable for neural networks using numpy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;examples from the real world behaviour of this plattform with lessons learned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;examples how we feature engineered the data by analysing the data stored&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a PhD student in machine learning/astronomy, and an AI researcher at Rasa. We make open source libraries for conversational AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon you will primarily communicate with your computer through conversation. At Rasa, we believe that this revolution in user experience should be available to everyone. In this spirit we have developed open source tools that use machine learning to make chatbots in a developer-friendly interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revolution-in-waiting for user experience is conversational AI, and this revolution should be available to everyone. The ability to communicate with your computer via a fulfilling and useful conversation will change the way we approach user interaction. Recent advances in machine learning have made this goal not only possible to reach, but possible to bring to the developer community at large. At Rasa we have developed a set of open-source Python libraries which can comprehend natural language and handle complex, interesting conversations. We utilise deep learning to bypass existing rigid conversational norms (state machines, if/else statements, etc.) and allow developers to make awesome bots simply by talking to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern neural networks have hundreds of layers! How can we train such deep networks? Simply stacking layers on top doesn't work! This talk introduces the deep learning library PyTorch by explaining the exciting math, cool ideas and simple code behind what makes really deep neural networks work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern neural networks consist of hundreds of computation layers! These very deep architectures consistently outperform shallower networks in a variety of tasks. However just simply stacking layers on top of each other won't work because the gradients are either vanishing or exploding during optimisation procedure. This talk explains the exciting math, cool ideas and elegant code that modern neural network architectures such as ResNets, HighwayNets and DenseNets are applying to circumvent the problem using PyTorch. PyTorch is a relatively new deep learning framework that is deeply integrated into Python. Unlike other frameworks such as TensorFlow and Theano, it uses tape-based automatic differentiation to run computation immediately, supports dynamic neural networks and provides a powerful GPU-accelerated Tensor library. The talk concludes with some real-world use-cases for very deep neural networks in chemical-genetic profiling and autonomous driving.&lt;/p&gt;

From zero to... what eye learned</title><link>http://pyvideo.org/pycon-de-2017/the-eye-of-the-python-an-eye-tracking-system-from-zero-to-what-eye-learned.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samuel Muñoz Hidalgo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am Samuel (Samu for friends). With a curious mind I studied computer science, then focused in machine learning and IoT as a professional career. I haven't given up on my plan to take over the world; that's why my coworkers know a crazy idea is coming out, when I can't hide any longer a mischievous smile. I like to meet people and understand other points of view, and in return I like to show what I can do and teach what I have mastered. But, what drives me crazy is rollerskating with disco music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to predict the point in the screen where a person is looking at? Easy to say but hard to do. An eye tracking system is the perfect project to learn the difficulties of applied machine learning. From gathering training data to building the final software with an acceptable performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will show how to build an eye tracking system from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the approach (machine learning) and the tools (Python ecosystem) are set, the important tasks are:     Making users addicted to a game built with Pygame in order to generate data.     Unleashing the power of deep learning over GPU with Tensorflow to train an Artificial Neural Network.     Exploiting the training model in real time so as to control a computer with the eyes with PyAutoGUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path is full of pitfalls and every clear single step to the goal turns out to be a mountain of small but very important subtasks. Every iteration is a continuous struggle just to gain a bit of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these efforts, at the very end we will see the difference between the theoretical and the real world. Our engineering skills will determine the usability of the new interface that allows us to move the mouse with our eyes; and we will learn that things don't need to be perfect, because humans are ...&lt;/p&gt;

interesting use cases, ranging from interactive smart applications and
real- time video processing, all the way to biometric security and
augmented reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will showcase the available &lt;strong&gt;tools built by the Python
community&lt;/strong&gt; and their corresponding pros &amp;amp; cons, limitations, and
complexity. While discussing the possible scenarios and what is actually
required to &lt;strong&gt;DIY with Python&lt;/strong&gt;, I will compare such handmade solutions
with &lt;strong&gt;Cloud-based products and APIs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: basic understanding of Python’s data science stack
(especially numpy).&lt;/p&gt;

possibile risolvere un problema reale e complesso relativamente alla
trasmissione di energia elettrica. Verrà spiegato il progetto
&lt;strong&gt;RealtimeLoadForecast&lt;/strong&gt; che è stato sviluppato per un importante TSO
(Transmission System Operator). Si tratta di sistema predittivo che
permette di fornire in tempo reale ogni 15 minuti ed entro 5 minuti, le
previsioni delle serie storiche dei consumi di energia elettrica
relativi a circa 500 nodi elettrici.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Si parlerà dei passi che occorre seguire per ottenere da un semplice
prototipo, un sistema &lt;em&gt;ingegnerizzato&lt;/em&gt; che lavori in tempo reale e di
come sono state utilizzate le librerie di Python per l’acquisizione,
manipolazione e processamento dei dati elettrici ed ambientali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saranno descritte alcune tecniche algoritmiche e di Machine Learning per
ottenere dei modelli predittivi capaci di fornire previsioni accurate ma
con tempi di risposta sfidanti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verrà mostrato un &lt;em&gt;esempio concreto&lt;/em&gt; di implementazione di un algoritmo
predittivo basato sulla libreria Deep Learning &lt;strong&gt;Keras&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

non una conoscenza di base di programmazione in Python e di Machine
Learning.&lt;/p&gt;

that you’re asked at least once to explain what actually means &lt;strong&gt;Deep
Learning&lt;/strong&gt; , and what’s all the fuss about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, answering this question in a proper way, may vary (and it has
to) depending on the kind of audience you’ve been talking to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are talking to a machine learning experts, you have to
concentrate on what &lt;em&gt;deep&lt;/em&gt; means, for the multiple learning models you
can come up with. Most importarly, you have to convince them that a deep
learning model would work by far better than a more standard and robust
Random Forest or Support Vector Machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if your audience is made up of engineers, they
[STRIKEOUT:don’t give a damn..] are definitely more interested in how
you implement your Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) rather than
understanding what are the implications of different &lt;em&gt;activations&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;optimizers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if your audience is made up of data scientists - who are a good
mixture of the previous two, according to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram"&gt;Drew
Conway&lt;/a&gt;
- they are more or less interested in both the two aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other way, that is the &lt;em&gt;unconventional way&lt;/em&gt;, to explain what Deep
Learning means, is from the perspective of the computational model it
requires to be properly effective. Therefore, you may want to talk about
ANN in terms of matrix multiplications algorithms, running on a (series
of) GPUs in parallel. And this is &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; the perspecitve I intend
to pursue in this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for PyData scientists who are interested in understanding
Deep Learning models from this unconventional perspective, learning what
are the libraries and tools they may leverage for their experiments on
GPUs. Experienced engineers may likely benefit from this talk as well,
learning how they can make their models run fast(er).&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk we will first introduce the audience in the world of human
mobility and related challenges. Then, we will briefly show how to deal
in Python with geo- mobility dataset and finally, we will go trough the
recent advances in machine learning and deep learning in the context
human mobility (e.g. prediction of the next visited place).&lt;/p&gt;

I strongly believe that power of data is not only in the information &amp;amp; insight that data can provide us, Data is and can be really beautiful and can not only transform our perception but also the world that we all live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk I will primarily focus on answering/offer the answer to these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why we need data science and why more and more people should be really interested in analyzing data and data visualization? (motivation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is data science and how to start doing it in Python? (introduction of procedures, tools, most popular IDE-s for Python, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What tools for data analysis and data visualization Python offers? (in each stage of analysis the best libraries will be shown for the specific purpose; as for data visualization we will focus particularly on Bokeh, Seaborn, Plotly and use of Jupyter Notebook and Plotly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to 'unlock' the insight hidden in data through Python and how to use it to transform not only public administration or business, but ultimately the transformation of the whole society and economy towards the insight &amp;amp; knowledge based? (potential of data science)&lt;/li&gt;

Using a hybrid approach of NLP and Deep Learning, it tries to combat logical fallacies that occur in pure deep learning bots, while still coming up with unique answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, it uses a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) long-short-term-memory LSTM deep learning model to capture intricacies in questions. As organisations cannot afford a bot making logical mistakes, verification through NLP is used. This two-step model prevents the downside of &amp;quot;no control&amp;quot; on deep learning, as well as the too static nature of classical rule based NLP models, and thus enables potentially higher quality answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A live demo will be available at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://deepcare.online"&gt;http://deepcare.online&lt;/a&gt; on the day of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python as a language for DeepLearning. Python is emerging as the facto language to specify Deep Learning Networks. In this talk we will explore some of the popular libraries like Tensorflow and Keras to see the semantics used to describe such networks and look a bit more under the hood at what is the python layer actually doing for these well known deep learning libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grid search over hyperparameters is an important but computationally expensive process in machine learning, particularly for deep learning and tree ensembles. In this talk, I will describe how one can use joblib's recently added custom backend functionality to do distributed grid search on Amazon EC2 for a TensorFlow deep text classifier that follows the scikit-learn estimator API.&lt;/p&gt;

​
Abstract
Deep Neural Networks are fast becoming the face of modern Machine Learning. But understanding how they work can be a real challenge, especially while you are trying to build a model. Google's recently published library, TensorFlow, includes a lesser-used utility called TensorBoard that can be used to visualize the structure of your neural network model and inspect how data flows through it. This talk will demonstrate some techniques which will help you use TensorBoard more effectively, and better understand how TensorFlow computations work. Code walkthroughs will be done in iPython notebooks, which will be made available to attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python has lots of scientific, data analysis, and machine learning libraries. But there are many problems. Which do you use? How do they compare to each other? How can you use a model that has been trained in your production application?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TensorFlow is a new Open Source framework created at Google for building Deep Learning applications. Tensorflow allows you to construct easy to understand data flow graphs which form a mathematical and logical pipeline. Creating data flow graphs allow easier visualization of complicated algorithms as well as running the training operations over multiple hardware GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensorflow data flow graphs and operations are written in Python. In this talk I will discuss how you can use TensorFlow to create Deep Learning applications. I will discuss how it compares to other Python machine learning libraries like Theano or Chainer. Finally, I will discuss how trained TensorFlow models could be deployed into a production system using TensorFlow Serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description :
&amp;quot;Neural networks&amp;quot; is the name of a machine learning technique that takes inspiration from biological brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Deep learning&amp;quot; is a term used to describe various 'deep' (many layered) networks that are capable of more sophisticated processing than the classic three-layer perceptrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in deep learning, especially the use of convolutional networks and the use of GPUs to process them instead of CPUs, have led to breakthroughs in performance on machine vision, natural language processing, and other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various frameworks have been introduced that facilitate easy experimentation with deep learning networks, amongst others, there are examples such as: Caffe, Theano, and recently Google's Tensorflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keras is a Python framework that uses Theano or Tensorflow as a backend.  It makes the building and testing of such networks much easier, as this session will demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will explain the concepts involved and go through some examples that will enable an intermediate-level python programmer to develop, train and validate their own deep learning networks to perform visual recognition tasks using deep convolutional networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will describe how to plan the basic network topology and will also highlight some common pitfalls and steps that can be taken to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: It will not explain how to set up a machine for these tasks, which is a job in itself. Nor will it explain detailed aspects of neural networks such as specifics of activation functions, optimizers or back propagation. There is just not enough time in the session. I will try to provide some useful links instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep learning: how it works, how to train a deep neural network, the
theory behind deep learning, recent developments and applications.
(length: 60 mins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(length: 60 mins)    In the last few years, deep neural networks have
been used to generate state of the art results in image
classification, segmentation and object detection. They have also
successfully been used for speech recognition and textual analysis. In
this talk, I will give an introduction to deep neural networks. I will
cover how they work, how they are trained, and a little bit on how to
get going. I will briefly discuss some of the recent exciting and
amusing applications of deep learning. The talk will primarily focus
on image processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you completely new to deep learning, please attend T. Rashid's talk
'A Gentle Introduction to Neural Networks (with Python)'. His talk is
in the same room immediately before mine and his material is really
good and will give you a good grounding in what I will present to you.
:)
You may also want to attend I' Lewis' talk 'Deep Learning with Python
&amp;amp; TensorFlow' after Lunch in the PyCharm room to round it all off! :)&lt;/p&gt;

in Python. We will cover some of the history of Neural Networks and
obstacles that were encountered in the 1990s. This will then lead onto
the developments in 2006 and 2012 that lead to the resurgence of
interest in Neural Networks and the rebranding of the field as Deep
Learning. These developments will be illustrated by means of an extended
example of building a classifier of hand written digits on the MNIST
dataset. We will start with a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron and then
build this up into a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder. All code will be
developed using the Keras framework and TensorFlow and can be run on a
simple laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
