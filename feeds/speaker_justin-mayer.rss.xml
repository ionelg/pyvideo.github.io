for decades, but recent high-profile breaches have underscored the
risks of password-based authentication systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that we can replace passwords with other factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;email-based authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one-time passwords (OTP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hardware keys (Yubikeys/U2F, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These factors can be used independently or in conjunction with one
another to provide vastly greater security than the traditional
username-plus-password combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees of this talk will walk away with a detailed understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why the traditional username-plus-password combination is failing us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why email-based authentication provides no less security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overview of one-time passwords and TOTP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to store/retrieve OTP codes, including password manager support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;state of hardware keys in general, and FIDO U2F standard in particular&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn how to implement these multi-factor
authentication methods in their own Python-based web applications,
with primary focus on methods for integrating email-based
authentication, one-time passwords, and U2F hardware keys into
Django-based projects.&lt;/p&gt;

Python developers to understand how to protect their applications.
Unattended upgrades, automated TLS certificate provisioning, enhanced
web security, and other measures can significantly reduce the attack
surface of the systems upon which our applications run.&lt;/p&gt;

unattended security updates, this talk briefly covers how to maintain
the security of Docker container environments, where the above
strategies generally do not apply. In such environments, an entirely
different approach and workflow is usually required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heartbleed, Shellshock, POODLE, GHOST… With severe security
vulnerabilities on the rise, how can developers protect the systems used
to deploy their applications? Unattended package upgrades can help, but
only if they are properly set up and monitored. Some of the challenges
include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many popular virtual private server (VPS) providers do not install or
enable automatic security updates in their OS images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“unattended-upgrades” on Debian-based systems installs automatic
security updates but does not actually enable them, potentially
putting unsuspecting users at risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some security updates (e.g., kernel-level) require a server reboot to
take effect, and yet users often don’t realize this until the next
time they log in, resulting in a system that is vulnerable in the
interim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
