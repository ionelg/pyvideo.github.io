how services like Airbnb, Uber, Slack and Skype are replacing the likes
of hotels, taxis and the office commute. As software engineers, part of
our job is accelerating this shift.And it’s easy to think that a shift
from moving atoms, to moving bits, is a net win for the planet.However,
moving all those bits for our sites around takes servers. And these
servers run on electricity. And most of this electricity powering our
servers comes from burning fossil fuels. And burning these is a key
driver of climate change - the kind of disruption we don’t want.So, what
can we do? We’re not going to stop sharing cat pics anytime soon, but we
can change how we build online services to make them greener, load
faster, and convert better, by borrowing techniques from web performance
optimisation and containerisation, as well as good old common sense.
This talk will show how we can start on the journey to more planet-
friendly, sustainable django web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what can we do? We’re not going to stop sharing cat pics anytime

greener, load faster, and convert better, by borrowing existing
techniques from web performance optimisation, containerisation, and
serverless, as well as good old common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will show how we can use the tools in the python
developer's toolbox today for more planet-friendly, sustainable web
development, and how this is also good engineering practice.&lt;/p&gt;
