Agile output is measured in form of sprint metrics such as burndown chart, cumulative velocity etc . Usually commercial project management tools provide user stories management and metrics out of the box. Many organizations do not have these expensive tools due to costs and budget or historical choices. This talk describes how daily agile metrics can be generated using Python for any reasonable project management tool that has an Agile template and a webservices API.&lt;/p&gt;

a web dashboard. The goal of this tool was to assist data experts with
proactive monitoring and trouble-shooting our equipment deployed in the
field. So I decided to design a real time web dashboard with status
updates and email alerts using Python, Django and R.&lt;/p&gt;
