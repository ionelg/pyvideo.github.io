This talk will discuss some of the challenges that we encountered, how we dealt with them, what we learnt, and whether we thought it was worth all the effort. (Spoiler: we did think it was worth all the effort.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't have time to give a full overview of MyPy, but I will try to cover enough basics that the talk is mostly accessible to people who aren't already familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;
