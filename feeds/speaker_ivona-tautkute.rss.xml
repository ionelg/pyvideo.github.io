Our search engine allows the user to take a photo of a room and retrieve with a high recall a list of items identical or visually similar to those present in the photo. Additionally, it allows to return other items that aesthetically and stylistically fit well together. To achieve this goal, our system blends the results obtained using textual and visual modalities. Thanks to this blending strategy, we increase the average style similarity score of the retrieved items by 11%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work is implemented as a Web-based application and it is planned to be opened to the public on Tooploox website.&lt;/p&gt;
