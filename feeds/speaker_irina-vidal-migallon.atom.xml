Defining your Deep Learning architecture, gathering the right data, designing your training process, evaluating your models and turning this into a pipeline that keeps everyone on the team (somewhat) sane - these all have their pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning has gone through the hype phase where it seemed like a skeleton key, followed by a phase of despair for many who found the building blocks to be too esoteric and the training code and process too unreliable. Deploying on a device with strong hardware limitations adds that extra spice to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk addresses a very specific use case: preparing a Deep Neural Network to be used for detection in real time in a mobile phone app. It is meant for hands-on engineers and data scientists who live in that area where writing scalable and testable code is every bit as important (and troublesome!) as understanding your loss function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will cover different steps of the process, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining a good model for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your device: it is what it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cargo cult or what is this layer doing and do we need it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering the right training data: who, where and how will be using your app?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer learning as a small company's best friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating different sources in your data pipeline. Evaluating earlier rather than later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on time and interest, we may also go over data augmentation and/or model persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
