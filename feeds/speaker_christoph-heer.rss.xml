&lt;p&gt;I’m an Infrastructure Engineer in the team behind SAP’s huge test infrastructure for SAP HANA. In my spare time, I develop web applications with Django or playing around with new programming languages like Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP operates a dedicated test infrastructure with more than 400TB main memory for its in-memory database SAP HANA. All custom implementations like improved scheduling, caching of artifacts and monitoring were implemented in our favorite programming language Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP operates a large test infrastructure to test its in-memory database SAP HANA. In 2010, we started with a single Jenkins master with ten nodes. But to keep our testing time acceptable for the growing number of developers we had to scale up, which led to multiple different scaling challenges. The current test infrastructure is powered by more than thousand physical servers and provides different services like continuous integration, code coverage and code linting for a huge C++ project. These services are essential for developing and shipping new SAP HANA versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk provides insights into how we scaled and improved our test infrastructure. All custom implementations like improved scheduling, expressive test configuration and caching of artifacts were implemented in our favorite programming language Python. With the flexibility and power of Python it has been easier to extend, optimize and adapt the infrastructure for new requirements like different CPU architectures and newer operating system versions.&lt;/p&gt;

in-memory database SAP HANA. The infrastructure provides different
services like continues integration, code coverage and code linting
for a huge C++ project with Python test coding. These services are
essential for the development teams and quality specialists. Without
these services developing and shipping of new SAP HANA version
wouldn’t be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, we started with a single Jenkins master with ten nodes. But
to keep our testing time acceptable for the growing number of
developers we had to scale up and that led to multiple different
scaling challenges. The current test infrastructure is powered by
more than thousand physical servers. Scaling of the infrastructure
was only possible with custom optimizations like improved scheduling,
expressive test configuration and robust tooling implemented in our
favorite language Python. With the flexibility and power of Python
it’s possible for developers to implement complex test scenarios to
verify features and mitigate regressions. On infrastructure side, it
has been easier to extend, optimize and adapt the infrastructure for
new requirements like different CPU architectures and newer Operating
systems versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk provides insights and stories how we scaled and improved
our test infrastructure and how new technologies like Linux
Containers can improve automated testing and software quality
assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
