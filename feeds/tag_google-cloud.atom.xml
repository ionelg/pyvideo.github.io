interesting use cases, ranging from interactive smart applications and
real- time video processing, all the way to biometric security and
augmented reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will showcase the available &lt;strong&gt;tools built by the Python
community&lt;/strong&gt; and their corresponding pros &amp;amp; cons, limitations, and
complexity. While discussing the possible scenarios and what is actually
required to &lt;strong&gt;DIY with Python&lt;/strong&gt;, I will compare such handmade solutions
with &lt;strong&gt;Cloud-based products and APIs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: basic understanding of Pythonâ€™s data science stack
(especially numpy).&lt;/p&gt;

where test cases are identified. Designing test cases for cloud
solutions requires a different approach from traditional application
oriented testing. The quality which is multidimensional will include
more attributes like network resiliency, fault recovery, reliability and
availability when it comes to cloud-based solutions. If such aspects
when not encompassed through test development framework, it will lead to
high chances of defect leakage in production in an agile mode of
delivery. We propose a strategy to design the test cases which traverse
across different levels of testing to find gaps using the Roboto
framework with Python. The solution provides the teams and the product
owners to get a picture of what is getting tested and how much of
coverage is done. The data can be used in team release discussions to
build confidence in the tests that gets executed as part of that
release. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework"&gt;https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework&lt;/a&gt; Testing
performed for features in a product is diverse and can be widely
categorized into functional, non-functional like reliability, fault
injections etc. Though developing test cases for functional changes is
achievable, arriving at test cases for non-functional requirements is
challenging in the given two-week sprint cycle of agile, and so leads to
defect leakage. Some vital modules in a project would have been running
in production for years and would have different sets of teams working
at different periods. Quantifying test code coverage and quality only by
a number of test cases per feature does not suffice as testing is
multidimensional and has to span across different levels. Measuring and
improving the test code coverage is the challenge generally faced by
product teams.&lt;/p&gt;

questions. Unfortunately, generating such questions can be very
time-consuming and it is typically done manually. In this talk we
will present a pipeline to automatically generate quiz games starting
from generic knowledge (e.g. Wikipedia). The pipeline consists of the
following components: (i) a parser to retrieve text from Wikipedia
pages, (ii) a Natural Language Processing module (based on the Google
Natural Language API) to extract information about syntax, entities
and relations, (iii) a Natural Language Generation module to generate
test questions and correct answers, and finally (iv) a domain-aware
module that uses domain-specific knowledge to generate wrong answers
(i.e. distractors). Every module is written in Python and it is based
on either available libraries or Cloud services (e.g., Google Natural
Language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: basic knowledge of python, minimal understanding
of text syntactic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
