to new coders. One way is to embrace the world of art. Python offers an
ecosystem that can take any curious programmer to merge the world of art
and technology. Artistic Python: Mixing Programming with Fashion aims to
show how Python, some hardware, and numerous libraries can inspire
anyone to incorporate coding into their artistic endeavors and vice
versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one thinks of fashion, several things come to mind: fabric, sewing,
and fashion shows. Rarely does one think about leveraging programming
and available hardware as components in creating a final product.
Artistic Python will present the ideation, design, coding, and creation
process of an outfit that incorporated Python programming, lighting, and
small programmable computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Adam T. Lindsay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Echo Nest Remix API (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/echo-nest-remix/"&gt;http://code.google.com/p/echo-nest-
remix/&lt;/a&gt;) was made open
source by The Echo Nest, a &amp;quot;music intelligence&amp;quot; company based in the
Boston area in the autumn of 2008. This talk will offer details on the
concise expressivity offered when editing multimedia driven by
content-based features, and some insights on what Pythonic magic did and
didn't work in the development of the modules. Audio and video examples
of the fun-yet-odd outputs that are possible will be shown.&lt;/p&gt;
