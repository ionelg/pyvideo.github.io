&lt;p&gt;The second talk was never presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This keynote explores the content of that talk, examining how to handle an unexpected blow to the leadership of an open source project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also a story about the events around that Sunday afternoon in Brisbane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a talk about mitigation against failure, software abandonment, speaker anxiety, the amazing Python community, and ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content warning: This talk contains strong themes.&lt;/p&gt;

solid foundation on the server, but it doesn't have a good user story in
the browser... until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BeeWare project aims to bring Python natively, everywhere. Using a
combination of the Batavia and Toga projects, we can develop and
entirely native web experience in Python, no JavaScript required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk, you will learn about how the BeeWare project has built
Batavia, a Python virtual machine in JavaScript; and Toga, a
multi-platform native API wrapper; a combination of which can be used to
build an entire web platform in Python only.&lt;/p&gt;

Unicode is the way of the future, with thousands of hours being spent to incorporate it into legacy systems. But what about Emoji adoption? From the technical to the social aspects, this talk will cover why the extended character set provided by the Unicode standard needs to be treated with responsibility by users and platforms alike.&lt;/p&gt;

Communication is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s between humans or machines or a combination of the two, trying to translate meaningful information is a lossy process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converting languages to use the new Unicode standard is hard, but once it's in place, you get this marvellous feature-add: Emoji compatibility. No longer do we have to make faces with symbols, or be forced to platform-specific emoticons! Rejoice in the extended character set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emoji has a rich history as a way to allow the communication of ideas in a reduced amount of data, and dates back to a time where this was important: SMS communications in Japan. However, as social networks feverishly try and clamber into this bandwagon, their implementations of the standard create more issues with miscommunication that aren't already possible with a 12x12 pictograph. 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the technical to the social aspects, mojibake and UTF-{8,16,32}, this talk will cover why the extended character set provided by the Unicode standard needs to be treated with responsibility by users and platforms alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is not just an excuse to see what parts of the conference stack can’t handle Unicode, I promise. 😇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, we idolise a 'open source contributor' as a person that contributes code. But what about all the other things in the software development lifecycle - documentation, code review, marketing, support - so much work happens without proper acknowledgement. Learn just how every little bit helps, and how to find and acknowledge these contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

open source projects, but often it is the work we do outside of code
commits themselves that get forgotten and unattributed. Hours of code
review, documentation, testing; organising of meetups and volunteering
at conferences; even just brainstorming and talking about things - how
much of these have you done without accreditation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this session, we will discuss what it means to contribute to open
source projects, what constitutes a non-code contribution, steps we can
take to recognise the work of our peers, and how projects can better
encourage non-code participation through recognition and
acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;
