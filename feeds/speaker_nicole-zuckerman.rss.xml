Social media is full of stories from experienced, qualified developers who struggle to get through even initial screening at tech companies, and those same tech companies' blogs are full of stories about how they can't find enough qualified developers. Something is very obviously wrong here, but what? And what can we do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from experience on both ends of the interviewing table, this talk will explore some of the underlying causes of bad interviews, challenge assumptions baked in to popular interview processes, and discuss ways to build more reliable and more humane technical interviews. This talk is for anyone involved in tech hiring who's interested in learning why current approaches so often fail, and how to fix it. No experience as an interviewer or hiring manager is required. Attendees will come away with an understanding of major systemic issues in how tech interviews are typically conducted, and a framework and specific suggestions for how to remedy these issues and build interview processes which are better and more useful for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

of our time to wait for code to complete execution and write print
messages to stdout. There’s one function in particular in the python
debugger (pdb) library that can give you a much clearer understanding of
what’s going on in your code, much more quickly; pdb.set_ trace(). In
this talk, we’ll identify the most useful things you can do when you use
set trace, that can make debugging exponentially more efficient and
enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

independent and productive members of your engineering team faster and
cheaper. We will focus on python specific resources and libraries that
will help you create a simple but effective on boarding program, and
talk about case studies of companies that have had success using these
techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

be of supreme importance for the people who use the things we build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you'll learn about essential topics in web security,
and you will gain hands-on practice identifying and leveraging
vulnerabilities in a Python-based web app. For each issue, we will cover
how your code can stay on the side of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
