their work -- RestructuredText, Markdown, and Jupyter Notebooks. How do
you combine all of these into useful documentation for your project's users.
Sphinx and friends to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to integrate documentation into your everyday development
workflow, apply best practices, and use modern development tools and
services, like Travis CI and ReadTheDocs, to create engaging and up-to-date
documentation which users and contributors will love.&lt;/p&gt;

Jupyter Notebooks and the rich Python ecosystem with libraries on a variety of topics can engage many learners of the sciences and humanities. Interactive content, using Jupyter Widgets and visualization libraries, put the student in charge of manipulating content and extending their learning. Giving students engaging content in familiar subjects encourages them to develop and use computational skills to build upon their interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One difficulty of teaching workshops is access to computers and the ability to install software on those systems. This talk will demonstrate how a workshop organizer or teacher can deploy JupyterHub easily for a class using the Zero to JupyterHub Guide, Kubernetes, and Cloud Services. Even if students only have access to smartphones, tablets, or shared computers, a workshop can be held using Binder which allows a notebook environment to be served at the click of a button to any modern web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

Audience participation will be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fake news on social media, dragnet collection of personal data, being asked to write code for the benefit of your employers but that's not necessarily helpful for your users, using big data to analyse the behaviour of users, government control of the internet, violations of FLOSS licenced code. These subjects and more like them are ripe for discussion in this panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think &amp;quot;Question Time&amp;quot; on BBC1 at 10:30pm on a Thursday and you have a pretty good idea of what it will be like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JupyterHub provides single-user notebook servers to many users. For
example, JupyterHub could serve notebooks to a class of students, a
