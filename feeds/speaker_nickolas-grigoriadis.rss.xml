We all know
how useless and frustrating out-of-date or just plain incorrect
documentation is. In this talk I'd like to demonstrate how Python can
help make writing documentation, keeping it up-to-date and verifying its
validity. It can be surprising what happens when other people discover
your little-but-well-documented API. Python has several built-in
concepts and standard tools to help making this easier, such as
docstrings, help(), Sphinx, Sphinx plugins, Doctests and generating
documentation off tests themselves. I'll focus on not only using Sphinx
as a tool, but also on how to structure your application/library/tool so
as to make writing accurate documentation as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
