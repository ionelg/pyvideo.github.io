Python 3 is the future and you'll need to consider both your upgrade plan and what steps you'll take after upgrading to start leveraging Python 3 features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk we'll briefly discuss how to start &lt;strong&gt;the process of upgrading your code to Python 3&lt;/strong&gt;. We'll then dive into some of &lt;strong&gt;the most useful Python 3 features&lt;/strong&gt; that you'll be able to start embracing once you drop Python 2 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of the most powerful Python 3 features are syntactic features that are &lt;strong&gt;Python 3 only&lt;/strong&gt;. You won't get any experience using these features until you fully upgrade. These features are an incentive to drop Python 2 support in existing 2 and 3 compatible code. You can consider this talk as a teaser of Python 3 features that you may have never used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this talk I hope you'll be inspired to fully upgrade your code to Python 3.&lt;/p&gt;

We'll get hands-on experience using list comprehensions, set comprehensions, and dictionary comprehensions during this tutorial. We'll also learn how and when we can slightly tweak our comprehensions to turn them into more performant generator expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will learn some tricks for figuring out which of our &amp;quot;for&amp;quot; loops can be rewritten as comprehensions and which cannot. We will focus heavily on code readability and code clarity and we'll discuss when comprehensions help readability and when they hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All new skills will be acquired through practice. We'll work through many exercises both individually and as a group. All students will also receive a cheat sheet which can be used for guidance during future comprehension-writing journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A laptop with Python installed is required for this workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iterables are a very big deal in Python and they became even more important in Python 3.  There's quite a bit beyond the basics when it comes to loops and looping in Python.  Let's learn some of Python's slightly more advanced looping techniques!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we'll take a step back and learn about how looping actually works in Python.  We'll then learn about a number of Python looping techniques that you've probably overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

it? Have you ever seen code that was simply a pleasure to read?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever wondered what makes code easy to read, this talk is for
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk we'll learn a number of techniques for refactoring code
to improve readability and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whitespace&lt;/li&gt;

experience? Let's learn some Python together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this tutorial we will work through a number of programming
exercises together. We'll be doing a lot of asking questions, taking
guesses, trying things out, and seeking out help from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we'll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of things in Python: strings, numbers, lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conditionally executing code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeating code with loops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting user input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

so hard to read? We'll learn what regular expressions are good for, how
to make our own regular expressions, and how to make our regular
expressions friendly and readable (yes it's possible, sort of).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most code is read many more times than it is written. Constructing readable code is important, but that doesn't mean it's easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever found unreadable PEP8-compliant code and wondered how to fix it, this talk is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-lived code must be maintainable and readability is a prerequisite of maintainability. It's easier to identify unreadable code than it is to create readable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about how to shape tricky code into something more readable and more maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk we'll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whitespace
self-documenting code
modularity
expectation management
We'll conclude this talk with a checklist of questions you can use to make your own code more readable.&lt;/p&gt;
