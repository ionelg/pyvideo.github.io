&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will guide you through the process of analysing your textual data through topic modelling - from finding and cleaning your data, pre-processing using spaCy, applying topic modelling algorithms using gensim - before moving on to more advanced textual analysis techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topic Modelling is a great way to analyse completely unstructured textual data - and with the python NLP framework Gensim, it's very, very easy to do this. The purpose of this tutorial is to guide one through the whole process of topic modelling - right from pre-processing your raw textual data, creating your topic models, evaluating the topic models, to visualising them. Advanced topic modelling techniques will also be covered in this tutorial, such as Dynamic Topic Modelling, Topic Coherence, Document Word Coloring, and LSI/HDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The python packages used during the tutorial will be spaCy (for pre-processing), gensim (for topic modelling), and pyLDAvis (for visualisation). The interface for the tutorial will be an Jupyter notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takeaway from the tutorial would be the participants ability to get their hands dirty with analysing their own textual data, through the entire lifecycle of cleaning raw data to visualising topics.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a very handy technique to model unstructured textual data, and is used heavily in both industry and in research to both understand trends in textual data and analyse new documents via their topics. Gensim is an open-source python NLP framework which provides an API to do robust, industry-grade Topic Modelling which is memory independent and super fast, while being very simple to use. The best part of gensim and python for Topic Modelling is it’s ease of usage and effectiveness. I would propose a small talk to explain how to effectively do topic modelling in python using Gensim framework- especially - after identifying topics from a large dataset, and then leveraging to perform un-supervised clustering, colouring topic-words in a document, and better understanding textual data for subsequent usage. All of this will be supported with examples from research and industry. [ My relationship with Gensim is through the Google Summer of Code 2016 program, where I am implementing Dynamic Topic Models for them ]&lt;/p&gt;
