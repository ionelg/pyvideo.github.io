This talk explores a few of the currently maintained libraries for unit support in Python and discusses the challenges and pitfalls of using them within the rest of the scientific Python stack.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers working to understand frictional dynamics often develop their own software to solve specific problems with constitutive laws that include history and strain rate dependence, which has limited interdisciplinary comparison and community standards. We address these shortcomings with a Python implementation of the rate-and-state friction constitutive laws, including tools to handle multiple state variables, dynamic instability, and variations in friction rate dependence with slip velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
