&lt;p&gt;Logging messages, unit tests, and using the debugger are best practices, but often left out of introductory programming tutorials. As a result, beginners come away with the idea that these time-saving features are somehow &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; or things to be learned later on. In this presentation, Al Sweigart dispels these notions by providing quickstart guides to Python's logging, doctest, and pdb modules, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why beginners (incorrectly) avoid these programming best practices.
The &amp;quot;if you're doing this&amp;quot; signs that you aren't using these best practices.
The 4 lines of code you need from the logging module.
The 4 lines of code you need from the doctest module.
The 2 lines of code you need from the pdf module.
How much time you'll save, not spend, by using these not-so-advanced modules.&lt;/p&gt;

1. Automate AWS With Python - Moshe Zadka
AWS is one of the best-known cloud vendors. Using the Web UI is fine when starting out, but automating cloud operations is important. Boto3 provides a great Pythonic API to AWS, but using it correctly can be subtle.
The talk will cover how to automate AMI builds, building Cloud Formation Templates and automating S3 bucket management.
Speaker Bio
Moshe has been involved with Python since 1998, when he helped obsolete math-related modules. Since then, he made some contributions that were not just deleting code to core Python, and has been a contributor on the Twisted project since its inception.

2. Yes, It's Time to Learn Regular Expressions - Al Sweigart
Regular expressions have a reputation as opaque and inscrutable. However, the basic concepts behind &amp;quot;regex&amp;quot; and text pattern recognition are simple to grasp. This talk is for any programmer who isn't familiar with Python's re module and its best practices. Stop putting it off, it's time to learn regular expressions!

3. Type uWSGI; press enter; what happens? - Asheesh Laroia and Philip James
You're a pretty knowledgeable Python web application developer, but how does that web application get served to the world? For many of us, uWSGI is the magic that makes our application available, and in this talk we'll look at how uWSGI works with the OS and the networking stack to make the magic happen.

Abstract
The internet and personal computer are central tools in many jobs, including professions outside of engineering. This makes web scraping and GUI automation are relevant to not just developers and QA testers, but academics, organizers, and office workers. This talk is an introduction to Selenium and PyAutoGUI modules. and programatically controlling your browser and desktop applications from Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web scraping and GUI automation frameworks have an intimidating reputation for a steep learning curve. While they do have many sophisticated features, the basics that most folks will ever need can be covered in a single presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation has multiple live demos to showcase these modules straight from the interactive shell.&lt;/p&gt;
