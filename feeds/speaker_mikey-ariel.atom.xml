&lt;p&gt;If you ever skimmed through a README, tried to follow a quickstart tutorial, attempted to decipher an error message, or typed '--help' in your console, congratulations -- you have encountered documentation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long gone are the days of massive books with never-ending stories about your software. Today's users are smarter and less patient, which means that we no longer need to document all the things, as long as what we do document is clear, concise, helpful, and accessible. And that's where the real work starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation requires some attitude adjustment, since prose doesn't neatly compile into binaries as code does. But Don't Panic(tm)! No matter what your role is in the community, you can apply a few key principles from the technical writing world to make your project more docs-friendly, and therefore more user- and contributor-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This high-level (and all-level) talk aims to introduce or re-acquaint you with topics such as content strategy, modular content architecture, tone and style, optimized DevOps for docs, and contribution workflows. Open-source projects of all shapes and sizes are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

[EuroPython 2015]

[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does your open source project need better documentation? Do you wish
that new users could get started with your software more easily? Do
you feel that your code contribution workflow isn't documented well
enough, or that contributors are discouraged from documenting their
code? How can you give your project docs the love they deserve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This high-level talk aims to introduce the main principles of
technical communication in the context of FOSS projects. It is
intended for anyone who interacts with docs, whether your project is
fresh off the dev environment or has been around since the dawn of
Git. Topics include tone, style, process management, structure, and
contribution workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
