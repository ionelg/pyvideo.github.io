&lt;p&gt;Well, in around 1980, there was Prof. Robert Axelrod and his ground breaking work using a computer simulation of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game and showing how that might improve our understanding of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Axelrod-Python team has been working for almost three years to reproduce that work, and the large amount of subsequent research that has been based on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll talk about how the project has progressed and, in particular, how we are currently wrestling with the original Fortran code behind one of Prof. Axelrod's papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll talk about how the use of paper systems led to a simplification of the ideas developed by Aristotle over two thousand years ago and how the thinking that we encode into our software today is still limited by that simplification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll give some simple examples and then describe how, for the first time in human history, we now possess technology that is perfectly capable of implementing a far richer understanding of the world than Aristotle could possibly have imagined - but how we need to change our own mental models to take advantage of that possibility.
Fair Warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a little known rule:     If, during a Python conference, a quotation from Monty Python is appropriate, then it must be used, preferably with audience participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you chose to attend my talk, you should probably familiarise yourself with Bruce's Philosophers Song&lt;/p&gt;
