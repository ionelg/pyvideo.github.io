years, especially in the field of high performance computing and
machine learning. When it comes to performance, there are numerous
ways of profiling and measuring code performance—with each analysis
tool having its own strengths and weaknesses. In this talk, we will
introduce a rich GUI application (Intel® VTune™ Amplifier) which can
be used to analyze the runtime performance of one’s Python
application, and fully understand where the performance bottlenecks
are in one’s code.  With this application, one may also analyze the
call-stacks and get quick visual clues where one’s Python application
is spending time or wasting CPU cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
