The characters: a developer, who's written a chunk of new Python code, and a team lead, who's about to review it. You'll see the code. It's not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if the reviewer waves it through, or lets conflict aversion get the best of them? What if the reviewer says it should be &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; but doesn't articulate how? What if the review is abrasive, or nitpicky, or laid-back? What if the reviewer rewrites the code right there and then? And if we fast-forward to the same team years later, how has this code reviewing style affected the quality and evolution of the codebase, and the team's culture, skill and sustainability?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See a fast-paced montage of ways things can go. Recognize patterns from your past and present. Learn scripts for phrasing criticism constructively. And laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
