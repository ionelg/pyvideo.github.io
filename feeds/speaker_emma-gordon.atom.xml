bee into a competition for “bad ideas”, a Python bee is like a
spelling bee for programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of spelling words, participants are given functions to write
and must spell them out loud - one character at a time, without
looking at the code that they're writing! Players must spell valid
Python and every character counts, including symbols and whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the twist for the second round (credit for this one goes to
dropboxblogs):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're now allowed to look at the code, but... you must now team up
with other programmers, entering alternate characters without being
allowed to communicate via any other means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for everyone to be able to have a go, we'll split up into
small groups to play - for those that want to be competitive, we'll
use a scoring system so that we can still declare an overall
champion. You're very welcome to come along just to have fun though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - a fun hour of slightly ridiculous programming games :)&lt;/p&gt;

3D-printed &amp;quot;hoverboards&amp;quot; ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With machines now able to perform many tasks better than humans, some
people are going to be out of a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not software developers, right?! Could a computer generate the
code you currently write for a living?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll take a look at one of the many biologically
inspired approaches to AI - Genetic Algorithms, and how they can be
used to generate code given a description of the function that that
code should perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler - you're probably not out of a job, yet...&lt;/p&gt;
