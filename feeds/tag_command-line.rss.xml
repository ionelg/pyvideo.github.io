Or maybe color the output a bit? Or do you want to write an immersive
terminal application like top, or even vim? Then you need to speak a bit
of terminal! This talk describes how to talk to your terminal from
scratch and goes on to show why the Python library prompt-toolkit is so
awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terminal emulators we run so many of our programming tools in are
more powerful than we give them credit for, and the key to that power is
understanding the interface. This talk will cover terminal colors and
styles, writing to arbitrary portions of the screen, handling signals
from the terminal, determining the terminal’s dimensions and scrollback
buffer behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminal programming can get hairy, especially if you want to support
multiple platforms like Mac, Linux and Win; along the way we’ll deal
with encoding issues, automatisation issues and look into 4 decades’ of
terminal communication. By gaining a deeper understanding of these
issues, we’ll be able to choose from the abstractions over them offered
by Python libraries like Blessings, prompt-toolkit, asciimatics etc.&lt;/p&gt;

infrastructure. It is easy to learn but rushing to use it with a limited
knowledge of its best practices leads to not reusable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating reusable Ansible roles is a strongly encouraged practice, in
fact there is a tool designed just for this purpose: Ansible Galaxy. It
comes bundled with Ansible and its purpose is to download roles from the
Galaxy hub and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk wants to show how we manage our Ansible roles and their
dependencies in a consistent way by means of Ansible Galaxy. It will
also offer an overview of how Ansible roles can be tested.&lt;/p&gt;

of the user activities? Or maybe limit user permissions? Or define
specific callbacks to react to user actions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;pysftpserver&lt;/em&gt; is an OpenSSH SFTP wrapper, written purely in Python. It
is yet another cool example of what you might already know: how powerful
Python can be while staying extremely simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk aims at presenting the tool and a few use cases in which it
was harnessed, including one with Django and Django REST Framework. It
requires a good knowledge of Python and Django and understanding the
basics of a SFTP service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resumo:
Probably as a scientist you need to develop your fancy new experiment code around some obscure inherited piece of legacy software in some obscure language. In the worst scenario you can't access the original source code. The only alternative is (sadly) run the command and capture their output. This dissertation try to review all the available alternatives to interact with external commands in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
