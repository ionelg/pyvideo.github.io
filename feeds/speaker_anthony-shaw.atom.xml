This was later switching for Go, but why? This talk will cover mocker, a container runtime Anthony wrote to understand Docker by rewriting its basic functions in 100% Python. Anthony will walk through how to write a Docker daemon in Python whilst applying it to real problems. Whilst the tool might not be production ready, it demonstrates some patterns, libraries and ideas for working with Docker containers from Python.&lt;/p&gt;
