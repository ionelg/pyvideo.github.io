I will explain the concept of algorithmic fairness and how it relates to the traditional view of machine learning classifiers. I will discuss ways to measure the extent to which a classifier discriminates against a particular minority group and showcase special algorithms for mitigating the level of disparate impact of a classifier. At the end of the talk, I will point interested audience members to resources where they can learn more about emerging trends in this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

As a result, researchers have developed special algorithms for detecting anomalies. In this talk, I will take about three different families of anomaly detection algorithms: Density-based methods, data streaming methods, and time series methods. I will cover both the mathematical and statistical theory behind these algorithms and provide code implementations. Afterwards, I will discuss useful tips I have learned  while implementing threat detection systems in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
