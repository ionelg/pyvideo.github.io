comparing to real world examples. This talk is dedicated to the
proposition to crash test Django ORM 80% of functionalities in 20% of
the time. Also I’m going to show the important features and capabilities
of Django ORM compare to most of SQL features. Traditionally, ORM is
presented in a “bottom-up” fashion, but I would like to propose
approach, on the other hand, is “top-down”. We begin by identifying a
rather short list of standard questions, or precisely types of
questions, that are often asked of relations databases. We then show how
these standard questions are posted in Django ORM, introducing and
motivating the use of its capabilities and features as they become
relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll explain how to build not only crop images or select data from
DynamoDB, but build real application, what kind of troubles are we
should expect, how to make decision is your task fit into serverless
architecture in Python or may be you should use, general approach. How
fast serverless applications written in Python, and more important how
to scale it.&lt;/p&gt;

We have lot’s of social applications that we are using every day, let’s say Facebook, twitter, Instagram. Lot’s of such kind apps based on social graph and graph theory. I would like to share my knowledge and expertise about how to work with graphs and build large social graph as engine for Social network using python and Graph databases. We'll compare SQL and NoSQL approaches for friends relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

[EuroPython 2016]

[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/what-is-the-best-full-text-search-engine-for-python"&gt;https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/what-is-the-best-full-text-search-engine-for-python&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare full text search engines for Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays we can see lot’s of benchmarks and performance tests of
different web frameworks and Python tools. Regarding to search
engines, it’s difficult to find useful information especially
benchmarks or comparing between different search engines. It’s
difficult to manage what search engine you should select for instance,
ElasticSearch, Postgres Full Text Search or may be Sphinx or Whoosh.
You face a difficult choice, that’s why I am pleased to share with you
my acquired experience and benchmarks and focus on how to compare full
text search engines for Python.&lt;/p&gt;
