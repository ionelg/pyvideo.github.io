&lt;p&gt;Dropbox has several million lines of production code written in Python 2.7. As a first step towards migrating to Python 3, as well as to generally make our code more navigable, we are annotating our code with type annotations using the PEP 484 standard and type-checking the annotated code with mypy. In this talk we will discuss lessons learned and show how you too can start type-checking your legacy Python 2.7 code, one file at a time. We will also describe some of the many improvements weâ€™ve made to mypy in the process, as well as some other tools that come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mypy is an open-source type-checker for Python. It was originally created by one of the speakers, Jukka Lehtosalo, in support of his PhD thesis, before he joined Dropbox. Mypy supports the PEP 484 standard for gradual typing in Python. It supports Python 3.2 and higher, as well as Python 2.7 (using function signatures in type comments, per a recent update to PEP 484).&lt;/p&gt;

development of mypy, a static type checker for Python, as a way to make
our multimillion-line Python codebase easier to understand, navigate,
and maintain. In this talk, we will discuss the benefits of type
annotations, explain how to use them, and give a peak into how mypy
works behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mypy is an open-source type-checker for Python which supports the PEP
484 standard for gradual typing. Originally created by Jukka Lehtosalo
as part of his PhD thesis in 2013, it is now under active development by
a small team at Dropbox which includes David Fisher, Greg Price, and
Guido van Rossum. It supports Python 3.2 and higher, as well as Python
2.7 (via type comments).&lt;/p&gt;
