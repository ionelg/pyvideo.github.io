classics - &amp;quot;Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented
Software&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contents of the book had considerable influence on dominant
programming languages of those days. However, design patterns were
not glorified by everyone. Voices of rational critic appeared,
pointing out that design patterns are just ways to compensate for
missing languages features by tons of clumsy code. If one implements
design patterns in Python by the book, they will get code that looks
awkward, at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is to present Python's features that either simplifies or
eliminates need for implementing design patterns. Even if you don't
know what design patterns are - don't worry. You still may see some
new interesting Python's features and their usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional methods of coping with concurrent programming problems are
well-known and described in literature. Many programming languages,
including Python, contain in their standard libraries tools and
primitives such as semaphores and can spawn threads or subprocesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the face of increasing interest in service oriented
architecture and building distributed systems, that span across many
independent server nodes, emerges a need to adapt traditional
solutions, so they can be applied in the new environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will share my experiences gathered during building a
modern contact center - highly concurrent system, which requires
certain resources to be accessed exclusively by several self-contained
components.&lt;/p&gt;
