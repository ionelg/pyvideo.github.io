more granular REST endpoints to return different payloads suitable for
the individual use cases of different consumers and just Exposing All
The Data, All The Time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter GraphQL, born at Facebook but now in wide use in many organisation
and with a burgeoning ecosystem of tools across many languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be examining what GraphQL is, comparison to REST APIs, its
potential use-cases and how to get productive quickly with Graphene
(Python GraphQL service) on your backend and Apollo (Javascript client)
on your frontend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll use real-world examples from Picsa, where we've adopted
Graphene-Django as the core element in our platform for building
financial services for low-income farmworkers in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be an introduction to these frameworks that should be
applicable for those who have no prior experience.&lt;/p&gt;
