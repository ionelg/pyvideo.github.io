What is this &lt;cite&gt;setup.py&lt;/cite&gt; file? What's the difference between wheels and eggs? Do I use setuptools or distutils? Why should I use twine? Do I put my projects dependencies in a &lt;cite&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/cite&gt; or in &lt;cite&gt;setup.py&lt;/cite&gt;? How do I just get my module up on PyPI? Wait, what is Warehouse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will identify the key tools one might encounter when trying to distribute Python software, what they are used for, why they exist, and their history (including where their weird names come from). In addition, we'll see how they all work together, what it takes to make them work, and what the future has in store for Python packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll build DIVSPL with RPLY, an implementation of David Beazley's PLY (but with a &amp;quot;cooler&amp;quot; API) and make it compatible with RPython, a restricted subset of the Python programming language. Along the way, you'll learn about lexers, parsers, and grammars, and in the end, you'll know how to build your own language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is for anyone who has ever wondered how computers understand programming languages, or how to create your own programming language. It will be approachable for novices who have never studied programming language design, but will offer tools and concepts that will enable experienced users to actually build their own language, if they so desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience should understand that a programming language consists of a set of symbols and patterns, and that an interpreter determines whether any given set of symbols and patterns is &amp;quot;valid&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;invalid&amp;quot;. The audience will NOT need prior experience or knowledge of advanced programming language concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching the talk, the novice users in the audience should gain an understanding of how a computer understands a programming language, including programming language concepts such as tokens, lexers, parsers and grammars.  Furthermore, experienced users should be able to implement a very simple DSL of their own using the tools discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

We'll even go so far as to re-implement the stdlib functions which cause them to understand just why they actually make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fun and entertaining talk. In the end, attendees will gain insight into functions they use every day, including &lt;cite&gt;zip&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;max&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;min&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;any&lt;/cite&gt;,  &lt;cite&gt;all&lt;/cite&gt;,  and more. Even the simplest of tools, when combined, can produce really weird results!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us use &lt;cite&gt;type&lt;/cite&gt; every day, but few can say they know it well. This talk explores &lt;cite&gt;type&lt;/cite&gt; and along the way, reveals how it relates to &lt;cite&gt;object&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;class&lt;/cite&gt; and more, eventually arriving at deeper understanding of metaclasses in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
