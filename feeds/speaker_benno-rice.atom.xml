It generates tweets based off a mixture of other Twitter feeds, Facebook posts and some other sources. One of the challenges in making this work has been getting decently amusing output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will go through some of the options available, ranging from simple Markov systems using markovify, through more complicated Markov approaches and will then look at systems based on torch-rnn and other neural network systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll leave this presentation with a decent overview of the ways you can transform content into new content and the strengths and weaknesses of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you've developed your application, it appears to work and you may
even have some tests to back that up. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One part of software development that tends to receive not nearly enough
attention is the process of deploying, supporting and maintaining your
code in production. This demonstration will give an overview of using
tools such as Hudson, nose, stdeb and freshen to automate the testing,
packaging, deployment and verification of production software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behave is a tool for behaviour-driven development inspired by the
Cucumber tool for Ruby. It allows developers and stakeholders to agree
on how a particular piece of software should behave using an
English-like Given-When- Then syntax and for that behaviour for then to
be easily tested in whatever manner is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will provide an introduction to behaviour-driven
development, behaviour testing in general and the behave tool along with
its advantages over alternatives such as lettuce and freshen.&lt;/p&gt;
