When paired with an IDE, testing gets a visual interface, making it much easier to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we cover “visual testing”: starting, learning, using, and mastering test-driven development (TDD) with the help of a nice UI. We’ll show PyCharm Community Edition, a free and open-source Python IDE, as a productive TDD environment for pytest. Specifically, we’ll show a workflow using pytest and PyCharm that helps make tests speed up development, or at the very least help to make testing seem less &amp;quot;in the way&amp;quot; of other development activities&lt;/p&gt;

What was the world of Python like in its first years? Did we have any clue whatsoever? A joke-focused tour of early Python, heavy on question-and-answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building open source communities is hard, and while there are best practices and lessons learned to study, sometimes it all seems random. Python became renowned for its community. What was it like in the beginning, and how did it succeed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covers the 1994 Python workshop at NIST. I was fortunate to be there, along with twenty-ish others, and was involved in the next number of years of stumbling around purposefully. The stories are funny to pass along, some of the lessons are accidentally valuable, and with a generous question-and-answer period, the session becomes a community chit-chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Everitt is the PyCharm Developer Advocate at JetBrains. Before that, Paul was a co-founder of Agendaless Consulting and a co-founder of Zope Corporation, taking the first open source application server through $14M of funding. Paul has bootstrapped both the PSF and the Plone Foundation. Prior to that, Paul was an officer in the US Navy, starting in Python and launching www.navy.mil in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;

Ever heard of it recently? Being a leader, then not,
in a large open source project over a long period of time generates a
lot of funny stories. And mistakes. And even, moments of wonder, not
always intentionally. In this talk I'll cover a number of insider
stories from the life of Zope and Plone, then analyze them from the
safety of perspective. The long view can help show what makes a big
project vary in success over time measured in decades. I will also
include stories and lessons from long-running, successful leaders in
other Python projects.&lt;/p&gt;
