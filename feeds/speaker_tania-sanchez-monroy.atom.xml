analysis pipelines over the last few years.
But... how can I ensure that what I produce as a Python
user is reproducible?
In this tutorial we'll be taking you on a journey down the rabbit hole
of reproducibility.
We'll be taking a step by step approach to reproducible scientific development
in Python.
This means you get a crash course on version control, execution environments, testing,
and continuous integration. And a guide on how to integrate all of these in your
software projects.
By the end of the course we hope you will have the necessary tools to make your
Python workflows reproducible no matter if you're starting a brand new project
or if this is ready to be shared with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
