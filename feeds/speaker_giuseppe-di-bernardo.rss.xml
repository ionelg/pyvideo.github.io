Computing and Data Facility is&amp;nbsp;engaged in the development and
optimization of algorithms and applications for high
performance&amp;nbsp;computing, as well as in the design and&amp;nbsp;implementation of
solutions for data-intensive projects.&amp;nbsp;Python is now used at MPCDF in
the emerging area of “atom probe crystallography” (APT): a Fourier
spectral analysis in 3D reciprocal space can be simulated in order to
reveal both composition and crystallographic structure at the atomic
scale of billions APT experimental data sets. The Python data
ecosystem has proved to be well suited to this, as it has grown
beyond the confines of single machines to embrace scalability. This
talk aims to describe our approach to scaling across multiple GPUs,
and the role of our visualization methods too. Our data workflow
analysis relies on the GPU-accelerated Python software package called
PyNX, an open source Python library which provides fast parallel
computation scattering. The code is well suited for GPU computing,
using both the pyCUDA and pyOpenCL libraries. Exploratory data
analysis and performance tests are initially carried on through
Jupyter notebooks and Python packages e.g., pandas, matplotlib,
plotly. In production stage, interactive visualization is realized by
using standard scientific tool, e.g. Paraview, an open-source 3D
visualization program which e.g. requires Python modules to generate
visualization components within VTK files.&lt;/p&gt;
